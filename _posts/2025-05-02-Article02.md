# 1) Source-available vs Open Source: What's the Difference?

## Definitions

### Open Source

- Open source software complies with the [Open Source Definition (OSD)](https://opensource.org/osd) by the OSI (Open Source Initiative).
- It ensures **free use, modification, distribution, and commercial utilization** for everyone without restrictions.

### Source-available

- The source code is publicly viewable, but usage is **restricted** in some way.
- Common restrictions include: **no commercial use**, **no use for specific purposes** (e.g., military, surveillance), or **time-limited licenses**.
- These licenses **do not meet the OSI criteria** and are not considered "true open source."

## Comparison Table

| **Criteria**               | **Open Source** (OSI-approved) | **Source-available**                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Source code access**     | ✅ Yes                         | ✅ Yes                                                      |
| **Free redistribution**    | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ Often restricted (e.g., commercial use, time-limited)    |
| **Modification allowed**   | ✅ Yes                         | ⚠️ Sometimes restricted or delayed                          |
| **Commercial use allowed** | ✅ Yes, in any field           | ❌ Often disallowed for certain uses (e.g., SaaS, military) |
| **OSI certified**          | ✅ Yes                         | ❌ No                                                       |
| **Long-term freedom**      | ✅ Guaranteed                  | ❌ Depends on license terms                                 |
| **Examples**               | MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, BSD      | SSPL, BSL, OpenRAIL, Faircode                               |

##  Examples of Source-available Licenses & Violated OSD Clauses

### 1. **SSPL (Server Side Public License)** – Used by MongoDB

- **Issue**: Requires open-sourcing your full stack if you offer the software as a service.
- **Violates**:
  - Clause 6: No discrimination against fields of endeavor
  - Clause 9: License must not restrict other software

### 2. **BSL (Business Source License)** – Used by MariaDB, Sentry

- **Issue**: Prohibits production use for a limited time (e.g., 3 years).
- **Violates**:
  - Clause 1: Free redistribution
  - Clause 3: Allowing derived works

### 3. **OpenRAIL License** – Used for some AI models (e.g., Hugging Face)

- **Issue**: Forbids usage in military, surveillance, or hate speech generation.
- **Violates**:
  - Clause 6: No discrimination against fields of endeavor
  - Clause 10: License must be technology-neutral

---

## Summary

- **Open source** licenses offer long-term freedom with no purpose-based restrictions.
- **Source-available** licenses may look similar but often include **non-free conditions** that disqualify them from OSI approval.
- Always check whether a license is officially OSI-approved before assuming it's fully "open source."

### 2) Artificial Intelligence Software

#### What does the OpenRAIL license try to do?

The OpenRAIL (Open & Responsible AI License) framework aims to provide a licensing model specifically for AI artifacts such as models and datasets. It combines the principles of **open access** with **responsible usage**.

OpenRAIL licenses:

- Allow free access, use, modification, and redistribution of AI models (openness)
- Include **use-based restrictions** to prevent harmful applications such as:
  - Military use
  - Surveillance
  - Generation of hate speech
  - Other unethical or dangerous use cases

The goal is to promote open sharing of AI resources **while mitigating social risks** associated with their misuse.

---

#### Would OSI consider OpenRAIL to be "open source"?

**No**, the OpenRAIL license would likely **not be accepted as an open source license** under the OSI's Open Source Definition (OSD).

#### Clauses that OpenRAIL might violate:

1. **Clause 6: No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor**

   - OpenRAIL restricts certain uses (e.g., military, surveillance), which violates this clause.

2. **Clause 10: License Must Be Technology-Neutral**
   - Targeting specific technologies or use cases (e.g., facial recognition for surveillance) also violates this principle.

---

#### Conclusion

While OpenRAIL licenses reflect an important shift towards ethical AI development, their **use-based restrictions** prevent them from being compliant with the OSI’s open source standards. However, OpenRAIL may serve as a valuable model for responsible AI governance beyond traditional open source.
